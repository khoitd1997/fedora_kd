# Key mapping notes

Store notes regarding customizations of Jetbrain and Vscode keybinding to be more efficient. These keys may need unbinding from the default first but have been verified to not affect major functionalities or would offer a replacement key for those functionalities

The goal is to use the Jetbrain shortcuts whenever possible
